## Project 1: Bank Churners Analysis and Prediction
* Clean the data and implement Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Apply supervised learning models (logic regression, random forest) to predict bank churners
* Analyze key factors affecting churn, and make better business decisions for improving user retention

## Project 2: Finding Undervalued American Options for Netflix
* Perform statistical analysis on Netflix stock prices
* Employ Monte Carlo simulation and improved simulation efficiency by 12.5 times using stratified sampling
* Identify more than 50 underpriced American options for Netflix

## Project 3: Subscriber Prediction for a Streaming Platform
* Design a cost-sensitive performance metric
* Build 6 different predictive models with feature selection and feature engineering
* Identify prospective subscribers in the upcoming 3 months and optimize marketing strategies

## Project 4: Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews
* Compare the performance of 4 different word embedding techniques (Default Keras Embedding, word2vec, fastText, and GloVe)
* Build the LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) neural network deep learning model to conduct sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews
