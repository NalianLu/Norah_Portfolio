Conduct sentiment analysis with Python on Yelp reviews employing diverse word embedding techniques and an LSTM neural network model
* Compare the performance of 4 different word embedding techniques (Default Keras Embedding, word2vec, fastText, and GloVe)
* Build the LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) neural network deep learning model to conduct sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews
